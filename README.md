# Solar-System-3D-simulation
3D simulation of the Solar System by propagating (Verlet-St√∂rmer integration) the orbit of each celestial body,  in addition to the interplanetary trajectory of Pioneer 10. The initial  conditions used to solve the n-body problem are generated using the ephemeris  imported from the SPICE files (spiceypy library).
